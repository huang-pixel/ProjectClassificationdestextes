What is Shish Kebab?

   Shish kebab is a dish of small pieces of meat on a skewer that is

The origins

   Nomadic Turks in Central Asia had the two staple foods of meat and
   dairy (1). Naturally, there have been a wide variety of ways to make
   them, but the practice of putting meat on skewers has been claimed to
   have come from soldiers who put chunks of meat onto their swords and
   then cooked them over an open fire. Kysaa-ı Yusuf was the first to
   refers to this as a kebab is in 1377.
   As with many popular, modern dishes, kebabs are mentioned in the recipe
   books of the Topkapı Palace kitchens from the mid 15th century. These
   recipes mainly made use of lamb, mutton and chicken. Beef was mainly
   used in the production of “pastırma”, a cured kind of meat (2).
   With the centuries marching on, there have been a wide variety of shish
   kebabs in Turkey, with the most popular being “Urfa kebabı” and “Adana
   kebabı”, which are both named after their places of origin. These kinds
   of shish kebabs are made out of ground beef and/or lamb and Adana
   kebabs are on the spicier side. The meat mixture is molded around a
   wide skewer and is barbequed, just like the original dish with cubed
   meat.

Etymology

   The word kebab refers more to the way it is prepared rather than the
   dish itself. Across the Middle East, the word refers to meat cooked
   without water or sauce. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it needs to
   be cooked over a fire directly, but rather any way of cooking without
   adding any water (2).
   The word can be traced back to the Akkadian “kababu”, meaning frying or
   burning, according to etymologist Sevan Nişanyan. The oldest recording
   of the word of is found in Mahmud Kashgari’s “Diwan Lughat al-Turk”
   from the 11th century, with the definition of a pointed stick.

Ingredients

     * 800 gr lamb
     * 4 tbsp yogurt
     * 2 tbsp onion juice
     * 2 tbsp olive oil
     * 1 tbsp pepper paste
     * ½ tsp black pepper

Instructions

     * Put all the ingredients other than the meat in a bowl and give it a

       skewer and let it marinate for at least half an hour. Depending on
       how you want to prepare them, you will want to choose different
       kinds of skewers. Use metal skewers if you want to barbeque. If you
       want to roast them in a pan, then wood or bamboo skewers will do.
     * Make sure to rotate them frequently to distribute the heat equally
       on the meat.
