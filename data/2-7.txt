ABOUT KEBAB

Kebab

   Kebab, (also kebap, kabob, kebob, or kabab) is a Middle Eastern,
   Eastern Mediterranean, and South Asian dish of pieces of meat, fish, or
   vegetables roasted or grilled on a skewer or spit originating in the
   Eastern Mediterranean, where it is mentioned by Homer, or the Middle
   East, and later adopted in Central Asia and by the regions of the
   former Mongol Empire and later Ottoman Empire, before spreading
   worldwide. In American English, kebab with no qualification refers to
   shish kebab (Turkish: şiş kebap) cooked on a skewer, whereas in Europe
   it refers to doner kebab, sliced meat served in a pita. In the Middle
   East, however, kebab refers to meat that is cooked over or next to
   flames; large or small cuts of meat, or even ground meat; it may be
   served on plates, in sandwiches, or in bowls.

   The traditional meat for kebab is lamb, but depending on local tastes
   and religious prohibitions, other meats may include beef, goat,
   chicken, pork or fish. Like other ethnic foods brought by travellers,
   the kebab has remained a part of everyday cuisine in most of the
   Eastern Mediterranean and South Asia. It is also popular among Western
   youth as a snack after a night out.

History

   Excavations held in Akrotiri on the Greek island of Santorini by
   professor Christos G. Doumas, unearthed firedogs (stone sets of
   barbecue for skewers; Greek: κρατευταί – krateutai) used before the
   17th century BCE. In each pair of the supports, the receptions for the
   spits are found in absolute equivalence, while the line of small
   openings in the base formed a mechanism to supply the coals with oxygen
   so that they remained alight during its use. Mycenaean Greeks used
   portable trays to grill souvlaki, small pieces of meat and sometimes
   vegetables grilled on a skewer. These souvlaki trays were rectangular
   ceramic pans that sat underneath skewers of meat but it’s not clear
   whether these trays would have been placed directly over a fire or if
   the pans would have held hot coals like a portable barbecue pit.The
   skewered meat, kebab-like recipe, existed as a favorite also in Archaic
   Greece, referenced in Homer. In Classical Greece souvlaki was known
   with the name ὀβελίσκος (obeliskos), dim. of ὀβελός (obelos), “spit”,
   mentioned amongst others in the works of Aristophanes, Xenophon,[16]
   Aristotle, etc. A meat and bread recipe which resembles the way pita
   souvlaki is served today, with pita bread was also attested by
   Athenaeus in Deipnosophistae and called the plate kandaulos.

   According to Sevan Nişanyan, an etymologist of the Turkish language,
   the word kebab is derived from the Persian word “kabap” meaning “fry”.
   The word was first mentioned in a Turkish script of Kyssa-i Yusuf in
   1377, which is the oldest known source where kebab is mentioned as a
   food. However, he emphasizes that the word has the equivalent meaning
   of “frying/burning” with “kabābu” in the old Akkadian language, and
   “kbabā/כבבא” in Syriac language. Tradition has it that the dish was
   invented by medieval  Persian soldiers who used their swords to grill
   meat over open-field fires. Kebab was served in the royal houses during
   various Islamic Empires and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast
   with naan or pita.

National varieties

In Jordan

   Jordanian kebab cosines are working to prepare minced meat in wide
   mixer then Add onion and garlic and chili and stir for about 2 seconds
   then add the parsley and salt and spices and mix well until the parsley
   minced peninsula then put the meat in a glass or plastic bowl and leave
   for half an hour in the refrigerator and then bring chopsticks
   barbecuing after soaked in water so they don’t burn. We tweaked the
   lineup and meat sticks with the Palm of the hand and pass the fingers
   it to take the form of kebabs, praises the formation process of coal
   and we lit and then put meat on charcoal and turn it to avoid burn and
   then prepare a sauce of butter and minced parsley and a bit of tomato
   and fat pieces of kebab when leveling, and kebabs on a plate with rice
   and we adorn him with grilled onions and progressive as possible with
   white bread.

In Afghanistan

   The Afghan variant of the kebab is the “kabob”.

In Armenia

   Kebabs in Armenia are prepared of ground meat spiced with pepper,
   parsley and other herbs and roasted on skewers.

In Azerbaijan

   Tika kabab (Tika kebab) and lyula kabab from mutton, as served in
   Qəçrəş, Quba Rayon, north-eastern Azerbaijan

   The main varieties include tika kabab, lyula kabab (doyma kabab in some
   places), tas kababy and tava kabab. The meat for tika kabab is
   sometimes prepared in basdirma (an onion gravy and thyme) and then goes
   onto the ramrods. It may be served, wrapped in lavash, with sauce-like
   pomegranate addon (narsharab) and other condiments.

In Bulgari

   In Bulgaria, the word кебап (kebap) is a generic term for meat stews
   with few or no vegetables. Dishes which are known in English as
   different kinds of “kebab” are not perceived as a distinct group of
   dishes. The döner kebab is widespread as fast food and is called merely
   дюнер (döner) thus not relating it to the Bulgarian кебап at all. Shish
   kebap / shashlik is also common, but is called simply шишче (shishche –
   “small skewer”).

In China

Main article: chuanr

   Chuanr (Chinese: 串; pinyin: chuàn), often referred to as “chua’r” in
   Pekingese and throughout the North, or kawap (كاۋاپ) in Uyghur, is a
   variation of kebab originating from the Uyghurs in the Western province
   of Xinjiang and a popular dish in Chinese Islamic cuisine. The dish has
   since spread across the rest of the country and become a popular street
   food.

   Although the most traditional form of chuanr uses lamb or mutton, other
   types of meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, may be used as
   well. Small pieces of meat are skewered and either roasted or
   deep-fried. Common spices and condiments include cumin called “ziran”,
   pepper, sesame, and sesame oil.

   grilled bread and lemons

   During Chinese New Year, it is common to find fruit kebabs candied and
   covered with a hard candy sugar coating. At the famous Wángfǔjǐng in
   Beijing, it is very common to find many kinds of fruit kebabs of
   everything from bananas, strawberries, and seasonal Chinese fruits, as
   well as scorpions, squids, and various Japanese-flavored kebabs all
   year long.

In Greece

   Souvlaki is a popular Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of
   meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer. It may be served
   either on the skewer or in a pita sandwich with garnishes and sauces,
   or on a dinner plate, often with fried potatoes.

   Gyros is a Greek dish similar to chicken kebab.

   The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork, although chicken
   may also be used. Lamb and beef are rarely used, except for souvlaki in
   USA.

In India

   Chicken kebabs from Kolkata, India

   Ancient Hindu texts, such as Mahabharata, mentions a dish made of
   marinated game meats roasted on large, open fires. Modern day kebabs in
   India trace their origin to the influence of the Mughlai cuisine in
   India. Kebabs in India are more or less similar to most other kebab
   preparations along with their distinct taste, which can be credited to
   the use of Indian spices.

   All the varieties such as sheesh, doner (known as shawarma), shammi,
   tikka, and other forms of roasted and grilled meats are savoured in
   India. Some popular kebabs are:

   Kakori kabab

   Shami kabab

   Kalmi kabab

   Kacche gosht ke chapli kabab

   Tunda kabab (prepared with pumpkin)

   Sambhali kabab

   Galawati kabab

   Boti kabab

   Hara bhara kabab

   Kathi kabab

   Reshmi kebab

   Lasoni kabab

   Chicken malai kabab

   Tikka kabab

   Tangdi kabab (tangdi meaning “leg of the chicken”)

   Kaleji kebob

   Hariali chicken kebob

   Bihari kebob

   Soovar ki saanth (Wild boar pork belly kebabs from Rajputs of
   Rajasthan)

   Rajpooti soolah (Game meat-wild boar, deer & partridge barbecue kebabs
   made with a special “Kachari” (wild melon) sauce by Rajputs in
   Rajasthan)

In Iran

   Kabab chenjeh In Khorramabad (chicken kabab)

   Kabab (Persian: کباب), of which there are several distinct Persian
   varieties, is a national dish of Iran. Kebab may be served with either
   steamed, saffroned basmati or Persian rice (chelow kebab; Persian: چلو
   کباب) or with Persian naan. Iran has more than seven types of kebab,
   which form a significant part of the Iranian diet.

   It is served with the basic Iranian meal accompaniments, in addition to
   grilled tomatoes on the side of the rice and butter on top of the rice.
   It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in Tehran) that a
   raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this
   is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this
   way unless it is specifically requested. “Somagh”, powdered sumac, is
   also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash
   on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly
   when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat.

   At Persian restaurants, the combination of one kabab barg and one kabab
   koobideh is typically called Soltani, meaning “sultan’s feast”. The
   traditional beverage of choice to accompany kebab is doogh, a sour
   yogurt drink with mint and salt.

   In the old bazaar tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid)
   and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the
   kebabs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several
   skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e
   lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while
   holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is
   quickly pulled out. With the two most common kebabs, barg and koobideh,
   two skewers are always served. In general, bazaar kebab restaurants
   only serve these two varieties, though there are exceptions.

Kabab koobideh (koobideh kabab)

   Kabab koobideh (Persian: کباب کوبیده) or kūbide (Persian: کوبیده) is an
   Iranian minced meat kabab which is made from ground lamb, beef, or
   chicken, often mixed with parsley and chopped onions.

   Kabab Koobideh contains: ground meat, onion, salt, pepper, turmeric,
   and seasoning. These ingredients are mixed together until the mixture
   becomes smooth and sticky. One egg is added to help the mix stick
   together. The mixture is then pressed around a skewer. Koobideh Kabab
   is typically 18 to 20 centimeters (7–8 in) long.

Kabab barg

   Kabāb-e barg (Persian: کباب برگ) is a Persian style barbecued lamb,
   chicken or beef kebab dish. The main ingredients of Kabab Barg – a
   short form of this name – are fillets of beef tenderloin, lamb shank or
   chicken breast, onions and olive oil.

Jujeh kabab, an Iranian chicken kebab

   Marinade is prepared by the mixture of half a cup of olive oil, three
   onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One
   kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4–5 cm long pieces. It
   should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should
   be covered. The next day, the lamb is threaded on long, thin metal
   skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5–10 minutes
   on each side. Kabab-e Barg

Jujeh kabab

   Jūje-kabāb (Persian: جوجه‌کباب) consists of pieces of chicken first
   marinated in minced onion and lemon juice with saffron then grilled
   over a fire. It is sometimes served with grilled tomato and pepper.
   Jujeh kabab is one of the most popular Persian dishes.

Kabab Bakhtiari

   Kabab Bakhtiari is a combination of Jujeh Kabab (Chiken Kebab) and
   Kabab Barg (Meat Kebab) in a decussate form and its name comes from the
   Bakhtiyari people.

In the Levant and Iraq

   Shawarma and other varieties of kebabs can be found at most restaurants
   representing this region. The preparation of Shawarma consists of
   chicken, turkey, beef, veal, or mixed meats being placed on a spit
   (commonly a vertical spit in restaurants), and being grilled for as
   long as a day. Shavings are cut off the block of meat for serving, and
   the remainder of the block of meat is kept heated on the rotating spit.
   Although it can be served in shavings on a plate (generally with
   accompaniments), shawarma also refers to a pita bread sandwich or wrap
   made with shawarma meat. The Lebanese shish kebab is called lahem
   meshwi.

In Malaysia

   Kebabs in Malaysia are adapted from the Turkish döner kebab. They are
   generally sold at pasar malam (night markets) and in shopping mall food
   courts.

   Normally, the meat, after being cut from the spit, is pan-fried with
   onions and hot sauce then placed into a pita bread pocket before being
   filled with condiments such as tomatoes, mayonnaise, onion, and
   lettuce.

In Nepal

   In Nepal it is a popular dish in Nepalese cuisine as well as Newa
   cuisine and known as Sekuwa. It is a meat roasted in a natural wood/log
   fire in a real traditional Nepalese country style. At first while the
   meat is still in its raw stage is mixed with homemade natural herbs and
   spices and other necessary ingredients. Sekuwa could be of pork, lamb,
   goat or chicken, or a mixture. Sekuwa is very popular in Nepal,
   especially in the Eastern Nepal and Kathmandu. Tarahara, a small town
   in Sunsari District of Koshi State in the Eastern Nepal could be called
   as the sekuwa capital of Nepal.

In Norway

   In Norway, the kebab was introduced by Pakistani and Turkish immigrants
   during the 1980s. The kebab has become a symbol of immigration from the
   Muslim world, and speaking Norwegian with an Arab accent or with a lot
   of words and expressions borrowed from the Pakistani, Turkish, Arabic,
   and Persian languages is sometimes referred to as Kebabnorsk (Kebab
   Norwegian).

   The kebabs in Norway are commonly served in inexpensive fast-food shops
   selling both hamburgers and kebabs. The most common variety, called
   kebab i pita or often simply kebab, is a pita bread filled with chunks
   or shavings of finely ground meat, shredded lettuce, various other
   vegetables and liberal amounts of sauce. Sweet corn kernels, slices of
   fresh cucumber and sliced raw onion are very common ingredients,
   however some shops offer a much wider variety of vegetables. The sauces
   are usually varieties of creamy Salad dressing, sometimes supplemented
   with a Chili sauce if the customer prefers a spicy kebab. Common sauces
   include garlic dressing, curry dressing and a sauce reminiscent of
   Thousand Island dressing but with a deeper red color and spicier flavor
   featuring chili and garlic. The garlic dressing variety is usually
   served together with chili sauce.

   A dürüm variety called kebab rull (kebab roll), where the kebab
   ingredients is wrapped in a thin bread and eaten in the same manner as
   a Burrito is also popular. Authentic kebab varieties with meat cooked
   and served on skewers are available in ethnic restaurants.

   The Norwegian Food Safety Authority in 2007 issued a warning about
   cheap kebabs. According to Verdens Gang they estimated that more than
   80% of kebab shops in Oslo use illegally produced meat. It was warned
   that such meat could be dangerous to eat because it could contain
   salmonella or other bacteria, and that it could be connected to
   organised crime.

In Pakistan

   Kebabs in Pakistan trace their origin to the influence of the Mughlai
   in South Asia. Pakistani cuisine is rich with different kebabs. Meat
   including beef, chicken, lamb and fish is used in kebabs. Some popular
   kebabs are:

   Bun kebab (Urdu: بن کباب)

   Chapli kebab (Urdu: چپلی کباب)

   Shami kebab (Urdu: شامی کباب)

   Shawarma

   Adraki Murgh Kebab (Ginger Chicken Kabab)

   Bihari kebab (Urdu: بہاری کباب)

   Chicken kebab (Urdu: مرغ کباب)

   Dhaga kabab

   Fish kebab

   Fry kebab

   Gola kebab

   Kache Qeema kebab

   Lamb kebab (Urdu: کبابِ برہ گوشت)

   Pasanday (Urdu: پسندے)

   Peshawari kebab

   Reshmi kebab (Urdu: ریشمی کباب)

   Seekh kebab (Urdu: سيخ کباب)

   Tikka kebab (Urdu: تکہ کباب)

In Turkey

   Before taking its modern form, as mentioned in Ottoman travel books of
   the 18th century, the doner used to be a horizontal stack of meat
   rather than vertical, probably sharing common ancestors with the Cağ
   Kebabı of the Eastern Turkish province of Erzurum.

   In his family biography, İskender Efendi of 19th century Bursa writes
   that “he and his grandfather had the idea of roasting the lamb
   vertically rather than horizontally, and invented for that purpose a
   vertical mangal”.

   Since then, Hacı İskender is known as the inventor of Turkish döner
   kebab. With time, the meat took a different marinade, got leaner, and
   eventually took its modern shape. The Greek gyro, along with the
   similar Arab shawarma and Mexican taco al pastor, are derived from this
   dish.[30]

Shish

   Shish kebab (Şiş, pronounced [ʃiʃ], meaning “skewer” is a Turkish word)
   is a dish consisting of meat threaded on a skewer and grilled. Any kind
   of meat may be used; cubes of fruit or vegetables are often threaded on
   the spit as well. Typical vegetables include tomato, bell pepper,
   onions, and mushrooms.

   In the US, the word “kebab” usually refers to shish kebab.

Döner

   Döner kebab, literally “rotating kebab” in Turkish, is sliced lamb,
   beef, or chicken, slowly roasted on a vertical rotating spit. The
   Middle Eastern shawarma, Mexican tacos al pastor, and Greek gyros are
   all derived from the Turkish döner kebab, which was invented in Bursa
   in the 19th century by a cook named Hacı İskender.

   Döner kebab is most popularly served in pita bread, as it is best
   known, with salad, but is also served in a dish with a salad and bread
   or French fries on the side, or used for Turkish pizzas called lahmacun
   or “kebabpizza”. Take-out döner kebab or shawarma restaurants are
   common in England and in many parts of Europe. Döner kebab is popular
   in many European countries, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

   In parts of Europe, “kebab” usually refers to döner kebab in pita. The
   German-style döner kebab was supposedly invented by a Turkish immigrant
   in Berlin in the 1970s and became a popular German take-away food
   during the 1990s. It is almost exclusively sold by Turks and considered
   a Turkish specialty in Germany. Australian döner kebabs are usually
   served in wraps which are toasted before serving.

   In England, kebabs or döner meat and chips are popularly eaten after a
   night out, representing a large part of nightlife culture.[citation
   needed] As a result, many kebab shops and vans will do their main
   business in the hours around closing time for local pubs and clubs
   (usually from 10 pm to 4 am). The same applies for Australia, Belgium,
   the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada,
   Scandinavia, Hungary and Italy.[citation needed] It is therefore not
   uncommon to find similar late-night kebab vending shops in
   holiday-clubbing destinations such as Ibiza and Thailand.

   In recent times, a variant of the Doner has become popular street food
   in Indian cities, especially Delhi, where finely shredded chicken from
   the rotating spit, is rolled up with mayonnaise and sour cream, often
   referred to locally as shawarma, enjoyed as a cheap snack.

   Health concerns about döner kebab, including unacceptable salt and fat
   levels and improper labeling of meat used, are repeatedly reported in
   UK media.

Adana kebap

   Adana kebabı (or kıyma kebabı) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab
   mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled over charcoal. It is
   generally “hot” or piquant. A “less hot” version is generally called
   urfa kebabı.

Steam kebab

   Steam kebab (Turkish Buğu kebabı) is a Turkish kebab dish which is
   prepared in an earthenware casserole. The casserole’s lid is sealed
   with dough in order to cook the meat in its own juices. The dish is
   prepared with pearl onions, garlic, thyme, and other spices. In
   Tekirdağ, it is served with cumin; in Izmir, it is served with mastic.

Testi kebab

   A dish from Central Anatolia and the Mid-Western Black Sea region,
   consisting of a mixture of meat and vegetables cooked in a clay pot or
   jug over fire (testi means jug in Turkish). The pot is sealed with
   bread dough or foil and is broken when serving.

   Other variants

Kebab Kenjeh

   Kebab Kenjeh (کنجه کباب) is a meat, specifically and traditionally
   lamb, dish in the Middle East. Originating in Iran and later adopted in
   Asia Minor,[citation needed] kebab Kenjeh is now found worldwide. The
   meat is cooked with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and served
   with rice, grilled tomato, and raw onion.

Kebab Halabi

   A kind of kebab served with a spicy tomato sauce and Aleppo pepper,
   very common in Syria and Lebanon, named after the city of Aleppo
   (Halab). Kebab Halabi has around 26 variants[43] including:

   Kebab karaz (cherry kebab in Arabic): meatballs (lamb) along with
   cherries and cherry paste, pine nuts, sugar and pomegranate molasses.
   It is considered one of Aleppo’s main dishes especially among
   Armenians.

   Kebab khashkhash: rolled lamb or beef with chili pepper paste, parsley,
   garlic and pine nuts.

   Kebab Hindi: rolled meat with tomato paste, onion, capsicum and
   pomegranate molasses.

   Kebab kamayeh: soft meat with truffle pieces, onion and various nuts.

   Kebab siniyye (tray kebab in Arabic): lean minced lamb in a tray added
   with chili pepper, onion and tomato.

Kakori

   Kakori kebab is a South Asian kebab attributed to the city of Kakori in
   Uttar Pradesh, India. There is much folklore about this famous kebab
   that takes its name from a hamlet called Kakori on the outskirts of
   Lucknow.

   One such story says that the kakori kebab was created by the Nawab of
   Kakori, Syed Mohammad Haider Kazmi, who, stung by the remark of a
   British officer about the coarse texture of the kebabs served at
   dinner, ordered his rakabdars (gourmet cooks) to evolve a more refined
   seekh kebab.

   After ten days of research, they came up with a kebab so soft and so
   juicy it won the praise of the very British officer who had scorned the
   Nawab. The winning formula that his rakabdars came upon included mince
   obtained from no other part but the raan ki machhli (tendon of the leg
   of mutton), khoya, white pepper and a mix of powdered spices.

   Chapli/Chappal

   Chapli/Chappal kebab is a patty made from beef or chicken mince,
   onions, tomatoes, green chilies, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, salt,
   black pepper, lemon juice or promegranate seeds, eggs, cornstarch and
   coriander leaves. Chapli kebab is a common dish in Pashtun cuisine and
   a popular meal in Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern parts of India.
   The kebab originates from north western Pakistan. Mardan is famous for
   chapli kabab not only locally but also internationally.

   Chapli kebab is prepared flat and round and generally served with naan.

   The word Chapli comes from the Pashto word Chaprikh, which means
   “flat”.

Burrah

   Burrah kebab is another kebab from Mughlai Cuisine, fairly popular in
   South Asia. This is usually made of goat meat, liberally marinated with
   spices and charcoal grilled.

Kalmi

   Kalmi kebab a popular snack in Indian cuisine. The dish is made by
   marinating chicken drumsticks and placing them in a tandoor. Various
   kinds of freshly ground Indian spices are added to the yogurt used for
   the marination of the chicken. When prepared, the drumsticks are
   usually garnished with mint leaves and served with onions and Indian
   bread.

Galouti

   The Galouti kebab is a dish from South Asia, made of minced goat, gaur
   or buffalo meat and green papaya, traditionally used to tenderize the
   meat. After mixing with herbs and spices, the very finely ground meat
   is shaped into patties and fried in pure ghee until it is browned. Like
   Lucknowi biryani and Kakori kebab, it is a hallmark of Awadhi cuisine.

   Many leading Indian hotel chains have taken to popularising the Awadhi
   food tradition, with the Galouti kebab being a pièce de résistance. The
   home of this kebab is Lucknow. It is most famously had at the almost
   iconic eatery “Tundey Miyan” at Old Lucknow.

   Legend has it that the galawati kebab was created for an aging Nawab
   Wajid Ali Shah of Lucknow who lost his teeth, but not his passion for
   meat dishes. Galawati means “melt in your mouth” and was perfect for
   the toothless Nawab who continued savouring this until his last
   days.[citation needed] The original recipe that brought many a smile on
   the Nawab’s face, albeit toothless, and many a sigh of satisfaction, is
   supposed to have more than 100 aromatic spices.

   Making kabab with minced meat is not an easy job and it need
   experience.

   By using kebab machine (Automatic kebab machine for big restaurant and
   mass production and manual kebab machine for mid-size snack-bars and
   take a way restaurant) any body is able to make kebobs.
