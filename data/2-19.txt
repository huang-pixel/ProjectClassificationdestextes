A real Turkish ‚Äúkebab‚Äù ‚Äì what connects kebab and Italian pizza?

   by Pizza Girl Patrol 25 April 2020

   I feel that I‚Äôve been assigned a very important life mission. And it‚Äôs
   not just making people aware of what Italian pizza is really about.
   Because it turns out that even fewer people are aware of what features
   it has‚Ä¶ a real Turkish kebap! Because what do you associate with it?
   Certainly, with nothing very delicious, rather with a medium tasty
   snack after an overnight party, stuffed to the brim with salads and a
   greasy sauce.

   Last year I spent almost a week in Istanbul and before leaving my
   friend begged me for only one thing, he said: ‚ÄúAnia, when you come back
   to Poland, be sure to tell others about what we showed you! Make them
   aware that what they eat is not a ‚Äúkebab‚Äù! ‚Äú

   As promised to Faruk, today I decided to explain everything to you and
   describe what characterizes this delicious Turkish kebap that you won‚Äôt
   find anywhere in Poland.

Turkish kebap and Italian pizza ‚Äì what connects these dishes?

   What connects Turkish kebap with Italian pizza? I already explain to
   you. QUALITY. And more precisely the high quality of the ingredients
   from which both dishes are prepared. Unfortunately, in Poland they are
   not associated with us in this way.

   There is one more additive that we commonly use in Poland, and which
   has absolutely nothing to do with these dishes in their home countries.
   Of course, I‚Äôm talking about ‚Ä¶ garlic sauce!

   Just as Italians don‚Äôt pour pizza with garlic sauce, so in Turkish
   kebabs we won‚Äôt find sauces in large quantities. And they certainly
   won‚Äôt be in a garlic edition.

   And one last thing. Turkish kebap and Italian pizza don‚Äôt have much in
   common with fast food. Of course, in its original form. üôÇ

What is kebap?

   Let‚Äôs start with the fact that what we call a ‚Äúkebab‚Äù in Poland, is not
   really kebap. Our guilty pleasure, usually eaten at night, is closest
   to the Turkish dish called ‚Äúd√∂ner kebap‚Äù.
     *
     *

   The name ‚Äúd√∂ner‚Äù comes from the Turkish word d√∂nmek, which means to
   rotate. It refers to meat rotating on a vertical spit, which is then
   scaled to Turkish pita, a wheat cake or served in a version on a plate.
   TERRIBLE SALADS or greasy sauces are NOT added.

   D√∂ner kebap served in a wheat cake (durum) is enriched only by a small
   portion of vegetables (tomatoes, onions) and a very modest amount of
   tomato, spicy sauce. Just like in the case of Neapolitan pizza, where
   the key to success is the dough, tomato sauce and mozzarella (i.e. a
   small number of ingredients!), Just like in a Turkish kebab you will be
   delighted with delicious, high-quality meat and wheat pancakes.

   The word ‚Äúkebap‚Äù means meat that is put on a skewer and grilled in a
   horizontal position. In Turkey, lamb is most commonly used for kebabs,
   but beef and chicken are also popular. What characterizes all these
   types of meat is their high quality, which is so different from what we
   get in Polish kebabs. This has a powerful impact on its final taste and
   our experience.

   The father of all ‚Äúdoners‚Äù in the world is Iskender Efendi, who was the
   first to come up with the idea to start grilling meat vertically
   instead of traditionally horizontally.

   There are many types of kebab in Turkey alone. Apparently, each region
   in this country has its own variety of this delicious dish. The name
   kebab refers to the way the meat was prepared and not served ‚Äì remember
   it!

   Kebabs can be served on a plate and this is called Porsiyon. We can
   also ask for the meat to wrap in the pie and then it will be called
   Durum. During my trip I tried only a few different kebab proposals and
   they were:
     *     DONER KEBAP, these are pieces of cut meat spinning on a
       vertical spit. It‚Äôs often served on a plate along with rice, fries
       and vegetables.

     *     DONER DURUM, these are pieces of cut meat (doner kebap) placed
       in lavash, i.e. wheat cake. If you want to take a kebab with you,
       choose this option. :))

     *     ADANA KEBAP, prepared from finely ground lamb meat, combined
       with salt, hot peppers, onions and other Turkish spices. They are
       studded on flat metal skewers and grilled on a horizontal spit.

     *     KOFTE KEBAP, i.e. minced meat stuffed with shashlik sticks.

   I hope that after this article it will be clear to you what a real
   Turkish kebap is and I made you aware that it has little to do with
   what we eat in Poland. I recommend you go to Turkey, especially
   Istanbul, and see for yourself how amazing this Turkish dish tastes!

   Where in Poland you can eat a real Turkish kebap?

   I can recommend the EFES restaurant in Warsaw, which is really
   delicious and serves truly Turkish dishes! My Instagram followers also
   recommended Maho, Big boss and Sapko in Warsaw. What else would you add
   to this list? üòâ
