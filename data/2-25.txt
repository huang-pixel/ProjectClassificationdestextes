   Success Case Study: German Doner Kebab
   Success Case Study: German Doner Kebab
   Summary
   German Doner Kebab is a franchise business established in 1989 offering
   a gourmet take on the doner kebab concept. Having grown from its native
   Germany and backed by a Scottish-based global franchisee, the brand is
   expanding rapidly, especially in the UK, and was recently voted the
   number-one place to eat in London.
   Often synonymous with cheap, decidedly non-premium eating occasions, a
   trend has emerged elevating the humble doner kebab to a much more
   premium, healthy, and influencer-friendly status in recent years. The
   brand German Doner Kebab is at the core of this ongoing development.
   Scope
     * GDK has effectively sought to reposition the doner kebab, changing
       consumer perceptions of what the fast-food staple can be.
     * Freshness and local sourcing are indicators of high quality for a
       sizable share of consumers globally, with both aspects featuring in
       the GDK brand narrative.
     * GDK has targeted the Generation Z audience specifically and
       successfully. Generation Z's perceptions of a product like doner
       kebabs are arguably more open to influence. As a generation, they
       drink less, and have different tastes and expectations.
     * GDK has global ambition and has achieved success through an
       aggressively development-minded franchising operation. Since the
       creation of GDK International, the brand has undergone significant
       expansion, proliferating across the UK in addition to its Middle
       Eastern and Nordic presence.

   Reasons to buy
     * Use GlobalData’s selection of successful and failed product
       launches and marketing campaigns from across the globe to inspire
       innovation.
     * Reduce the risk of failure by learning from brands/products that
       have under-performed: failed innovation can severely impact profit
       and reputation.
     * Understand the relevant consumer trends and attitudes that drive
       and support innovation success.
     * Obtain a broader appreciation of the consumer packaged goods
       industry by gaining insights from both within and outside of your
       sector.
