Meat on a stick.

     * Writer Carolyn Ali

   NUVO Magazine: Kebabs

   The first clue is often a subtle aroma, a heady mix of cooked meat and
   charcoal wafting on an otherwise fresh breeze. The scent triggers a
   primal hunger, and suddenly you notice a haze of smoke rising nearby. A
   handful of onlookers are gathered around something you can’t quite make
   out. As you move closer, an opening reveals a cook tending a simple
   grill neatly lined with a dozen or more skewers of meat. With the
   nimbleness of a classical piano player, the cook rotates the base of
   each skewer to flip the meat, occasionally criss-crossing his hands to
   transfer some to a cooler part of the grill. Then he whisks off several
   perfectly burnished morsels and lays them gently on a plate or
   flatbread.

   They’re a local specialty cooked by street vendors the world over at
   festivals, but they’re also found in pubs and even refined sit-down
   restaurants. The more one travels, the more one realizes that virtually
   every country has a tradition of skewered, grilled meat. Call them
   kebabs, souvlaki, satay, yakitori, or a host of other names and
   spelling variations—meat on a stick is universal.

   Kebabs are associated with the Arab world, and they have strong roots
   in ancient Persian cuisine. Merriam-Webster traces the first known use
   of the word to 1673 from the Arabic or Persian kabāb or the
   Turkish kebap. In The World of Kebabs, cookbook author Anand Prakash
   states that food historians generally attribute kebabs’ origins to
   ancient Turkey, and their popularity spread through the Ottoman Empire.
   “It is widely believed that both the soldiers of the Ottoman Turk
   armies and wandering nomads killed wild animals and cooked the meat on
   their swords and lances over an open fire,” Prakash writes.
   Domesticated lamb, beef, pork, and poultry eventually replaced wild
   game, and smaller metal skewers replaced swords. Grilled, skewered meat
   then travelled through Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the
   Middle East.

   “Arabs carried the dream of these morsels to far-off lands where they
   have traded since antiquity—India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
   Vietnam, and even as far as Japan,” writes Madhur Jaffrey in her
   book From Curries to Kebabs: Recipes from the Indian Spice Trail.
   Jaffrey notes that Indian cuisine has a similar tradition of skewered
   meat dating back to 400 BC, but as the Arab influence spread, a process
   of transformation began. Local traditions evolved with new methods and
   flavours, and kebabs were transformed.

   Today, countless countries put their own spins on kebabs. In Southeast
   Asia, they are most often found at humble street stalls, where the meat
   is threaded onto short bamboo rather than metal skewers. Satays, one of
   the national dishes of Indonesia, have numerous regional variations. In
   Thailand, pork or chicken satays are marinated in a curry-paste mixture
   and served with peanut sauce and a sweet-sour cucumber relish. In
   Vietnam, a lemon grass stalk stands in for the skewer, and shrimp paste
   is pressed around it for an aromatic treat.

   In Japan, yakitori is more of an indoor sport. At cozy mom-and-pop
   restaurants, salarymen hoist mugs of Kirin and idly watch cooks shuffle
   bamboo sticks over a charcoal grill. The preparation is
   simple—bite-sized pieces of chicken sprinkled with salt or a glaze of
   mirin, soy, sugar, and sake—but the range of options is impressive.
   Every part of the bird is offered pierced, from springy gizzards to
   crisp, succulent skin. Pork also gets play here, and skewered,
   bacon-wrapped asparagus is not to be missed.

   Brazilians, too, settle into restaurants to enjoy their meat on a
   stick, but on a much larger scale. At churrascaria steak houses, cooks
   use rotisserie spits to grill large cuts of beef, lamb, pork, sausage,
   and more. Servers bring the meat rodizio style, weaving through tables
   while wielding arm’s-length skewers and knives to shave off exactly
   what the diner desires right at the table.

   The global variations go on—skewered beef hearts in Peru,
   lamb arrosticini in Italy—and the ancient method of skewering endures.
   Author Prakash notes that chelo kabab is considered the national dish
   of Iran; chunks of lamb are marinated in a mixture of onion and lemon
   juices and yogurt, and the grilled meat is served over buttered rice.
   In Turkey, lamb also remains popular; preparation varies from hefty,
   cumin-spiced chunks to minced kofte seasoned with parsley and wrapped
   around a flat metal skewer. The doner kebap involves a vertical spit;
   layers of lamb, chicken, or beef are stacked with fat, grilled slowly,
   shaved off to order, and stuffed inside flatbread with a variety of
   condiments. Known as gyros in Greece, and shawarma in Lebanon and other
   Arabic-speaking countries, the popularity of this quick meal extends to
   Canadians—Halifax lays claim to its own beef version known as the
   Halifax donair, with a distinctively sweet sauce.

   In fact, it’s not difficult to find any of the above meat-on-a-stick
   varieties in large Canadian cities. Thai restaurant Maenam in
   Vancouver, for example, offers free-range chicken satays, while
   Yakitori Bar in Toronto skewers everything from chicken thighs to
   gizzards. And the summer grilling season opens up home backyards to
   endless skewered possibilities.

   So when you smell that tantalizing aroma and see the smoke rising, draw
   closer. As people around the world know, meat on a stick not only
   signals a good meal, but good fun.
