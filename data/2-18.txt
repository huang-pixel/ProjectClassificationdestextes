   Kebabs are a popular Middle Eastern food made by mounting pieces of
   meat and/or vegetables on a skewer and mounting the skewer on a grill.
   This food can be found in places like Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Israel,
   Iraq, and numerous other nations in the Middle East, going by a variety
   of names. It is also popular in areas with a big Middle Eastern
   population, such as parts of Britain and the United States.

   The word “kebab” is Turkish for “grilled meat.” The most familiar form
   of kebab for many people is the shish kebab, made with meat which is
   cut into chunks and lightly seasoned before being skewered. Many people
   also like to add vegetable chunks to their shish kebabs, such as
   onions, peppers, squash, and mushrooms. It is also possible to find
   kebabs made with long strips of meat, along with doner kebabs, made by
   grinding meat, forming it into a cylinder around a skewer, and
   slow-roasting it. In India, people eat kathi kebab, a form of kebab
   cooked in a tandoor oven.

   Lamb is one of the most common meats for kebab in the Middle East,
   although chicken and beef are not unheard of. Pork kebabs can be
   difficult to find, as both Jews and Muslims avoid pork for religious
   reasons, and in India, beef can be rare, due to the large Hindu
   population. The seasoning for kebabs is typically kept simple;
   sometimes only salt, pepper, and olive oil are used, allowing the
   natural flavor of the meat to develop during the grilling.

   Kebabs can be eaten as street food, often paired with a flatbread, and
   they may also be served over rice, lentils, and other foods. An
   assortment of sauces can be used to dress kebabs, depending on regional
   tastes. Tangy yogurt sauces, tahini-based sauces, savory chutneys, and
   spicy pepper sauces are all fairly common in the Middle East, and some
   cooks get more adventurous with things like peanut sauce, coriander
   chutney, or even slightly sweet sauces such as fruit chutneys.

   Many Middle Eastern restaurants offer kebabs as part of their menu,
   since this food is so well-known. Kebabs are also very easy to make at
   home. If you have a grill, you can make kebabs in the traditional
   style, but you can also roast kebabs in the oven or fry them in a pan.
   Kebabs can make an excellent casual party food, and they can be served
   chilled as well as hot. If you have picky eaters in your household, an
   assemble-your-own kebab night can be one way to get them more involved
   in the cooking process.

   I think that there is a silent war among different countries over
   kebab.

   Has anyone noticed that the Turkish doner, Arabic shwarma and Greek
   gyros are the same thing?! But they have different names and you cannot
   dare call one as the other. I know that sauces and spices differ but
   the main ingredient- the meat and the method of cooking it is exactly
   the same.

   So which name should you refer to it by? That depends on which
   restaurant or whose house you are at. Be careful because it can be a
   matter of national pride!

   My favorite kebabs are the ones made with minced meat. I like beef and
   chicken kebabs too but they seem a little dry for my taste.

   Minced meat kebabs, on the other hand, are mixed with onions and spices
   so they come out much more moist and flavor-full after cooking. Also,
   if the selection of the meat is not good, the kebabs might not come out
   good, but I have not had any problems with minced meat. It's always
   moist and easy to chew. Plus, you can add whichever spices you like
   into it.

   I know that kebabs seem to have originated in the Middle East and this
   may be true. But I also think that kebab is more of a descriptive word
   about how the meat is being cooked rather than a specific dish.

   I heard that kebab, in Persian, means "water" and "less." Probably
   referring to the meat being cooked without water.

   Who knows since when humans have been cooking meat over fire for their
   meals, ever since humans and fire existed, I suppose. I think that
   there is no requirement to arrange meat with vegetables for something
   to be called kebab. I think we can call any meat cooked over a grill
   kebab really.
