Kebab case

   Kebab case -- or kebab-case -- is a programming variable naming
   convention where a developer replaces the spaces between words with a
   dash.

   Programming variable names should be descriptive. Two or more words are
   often required to properly convey a resource's meaning. However, most
   programming languages don't allow spaces between words.

   The kebab case naming convention attempts to overcome this limitation
   by replacing spaces between words with a dash.

   The term comes from the associated imagery of a skewer in a kebab. The
   skewer pierces multiple piece of food together on a shish kebab. In
   code, the dash represents the skewer and keeps multiple words together
   to describe a resource's meaning, a la a shish kebab.

Kebab case examples

   Here are three examples of the kebab case naming convention:
     * descriptive-variable-name
     * INTERESTING-TEXT-FILE
     * naming-conventions-webpage

Kebab case vs. snake case

   Kebab case is a similar naming convention to snake case -- or
   snake_case. Both conventions help a developer read code because the
   white space -- either a dash in kebab case or an underscore in snake
   case -- between words reads like a normal sentence.
   Variable naming conventions

   Snake case contrasts more distinctly with the CamelCase naming
   convention. In CamelCase, whitespace is removed between compound words.
   It replaces the dash or underscore with an uppercase letter to
   represent the start of the next word. For example:
     * snake_case_example
     * CamelCaseExample
     * kebab-case-example

Scream kebabs

   If a developer uses all uppercase letters in a variable with the kebab
   case convention, it's known as a scream kebab. The term owes its name
   to the thought that when people on social media type sentences with
   upper case letters, they're screaming. For example:
     * THIS-IS-A-SCREAM-KEBAB
     * this-is-not-a-scream-kebab

Problems with kebab case

   The biggest problem with kebab case lies mainly on the use of a dash.
   Many programming languages will interpret the dash as a minus sign, and
   it unintentionally creates software bugs that are difficult to isolate
   and troubleshoot.

   Similarly, many programming languages -- such as Jekyll -- will assume
   numbers separated by a dash are dates. This misinterpretation can cause
   problems when a developer uses kebab case with spreadsheets or
   calendar-based applications.

   In the software development community, snake case is typically the
   preferred naming convention. Snake case creates the maximum white space
   between compound words in a variable with an underscore.

   While kebab case can be useful, a developer must be aware that a dash
   can cause unintentional issues with non-letter code.
