   Spinneys’ social media manager and passionate cook Ankiet Gulabani
   seeks out the most tender, juicy morsels of meat in Dubai

   What is a kebab? As many of us know it here in the Middle East, it’s
   small morsels of fatty, unctuous meat that are either strung together
   on a skewer or shaped around one, before being cooked on an open fire
   over coals or lowered into a tandoor. This barbecuing technique cooks
   the meat quickly and to juicy, tender perfection. The Maillard reaction
   kicks in at this stage too, caramelising the exterior of the meat and
   producing a somewhat umami flavour that is really what makes the kebab
   so irresistible.

   Every culture has its own kebab, and each is delicious in its own way.
   In Japan, there are saucy, glazed yakitori; herby souvlaki come
   straight off the gyros in Greece; and you’ll find spicy, peanut-heavy
   satay in Thailand. All these versions offer different flavours and
   complexities, but they’re all united by the same technique made popular
   by prehistoric man several millennia ago and some nomadic warrior who
   used his sword to cook a piece of meat.

   Over the last few weeks, I traipsed through several of Dubai’s kebab
   offerings in a bit of a food coma to seek out some of the best kebabs
   in the city. I’m was looking for tender meat, a robust marinade, fresh
   accompaniments and a whole lot of flavour.

Al Ustad Special Kebab

   Near the mouth of Dubai Creek lies Al Ustad Special Kebab, previously
   called Ostadi, which comes from the Urdu word for “master”.

   The kebabs at this 46-year-old establishment are seriously good. Go for
   the tangy chicken and mutton yoghurt kebabs (kabab khas) or the smoky
   cholo kebab, which is paired with buttery saffron rice studded with
   sour barberries. Roll up the khubz bread that is served alongside the
   onion shish kebabs and eat with cool mint yoghurt and chips. Get the
   mixed kebab platter too, so you can try everything.

The Meating Room

   After Abdul’s secret marinade became wildly popular at backyard
   barbecue parties, he and two childhood friends Kiev and Jacob came
   together to start the Meating Room in Al Karama. The focus of the
   restaurant is the grill, and they do a mean chicken boti kebab (titled
   Bihari Bhaiya on the menu), which is melt-in-the-mouth soft, no doubt
   from a long marination. The flavours are distinctly Indian here and the
   yoghurt and chickpea flour coating clings to every morsel of the
   chicken. But be warned: they don’t shy away from adding that extra bit
   of spice to their dishes.

Kaftan

   A kebabpci is what you would call a kebab maker in Turkey and the one
   manning the kitchens at Kaftan has hit the sweet spot when it comes to
   Turkish adana kebabs of finely minced lamb.

   The idea is to highlight the flavour of the meat rather than overpower
   it with seasoning, and the chargrilled adana kebab at Kaftan comes to
   the table laid out on a piece of bread to catch the juices. It is
   served with a side of rice and acidic onions, which cut through the
   richness of the kebab. It is mildly spiced and very tender.

Bait Maryam

   It’s easy to mess up a shish taook because it is made with chicken
   breast and overcooking it would immediately result in chewy, rubbery
   meat. Bait Maryam does justice to this Levantine classic with
   effortlessly juicy meat that has been marinated in yoghurt and spices.
   Be sure to also try the Maryam’s Kebab – ground lamb kebabs with cheese
   and pistachios. The cheese melts into the kebab upon cooking, keeping
   the interior from drying out, and the pistachios add a bite and mild
   sweetness.

"Every culture has its own kebab, and each is delicious in its own way"

Gbemi’s Kitchen

   Perhaps an unlikely addition to this list, Gbemi’s Kitchen serves
   “urban African soul food” at its new JLT outpost. It is here that I get
   my first taste of beef suya, which is thin strips of beef tenderloin
   pressed into a peanut-based spice mix, then threaded onto a skewer and
   cooked over a fire. The kebab is basted with oil so that both the kebab
   and the peanut marinade take on an earthy, deeply smoky flavour. It
   comes to the table served with slivers of raw pink onion and extra suya
   spice mix sprinkled generously on top. This dish makes a perfect casual
   snack.
