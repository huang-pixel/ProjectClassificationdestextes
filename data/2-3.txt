Kebab Culture

   September 16, 2020

   Iran’s national dish, the kebab, comes in all types, sizes, and
   flavours. We’ve picked out the best, and where to try them across Iran

   The humble kebab – skewered chunks of marinated meat, grilled or
   roasted over hot coals – has been cooked in Iran for centuries and has
   become the country’s national dish. Persian kebabs come in all
   varieties and are often made by wrapping patties of minced lamb or beef
   around a skewer. Sometimes they are just unadulterated chunks of
   marinated meat or chicken threaded onto a spike and barbecued.
   Marinating, shaping and cooking the humble kebab has become an art form
   in cities from Shiraz to Tabriz. Most kebabs come with a side of
   grilled tomato (scoop out the flesh and leave the skins) and raw
   shallots or onions, and served with minted yoghurt. Wash it all down
   with a doogh – a minty yoghurt and sparkling water drink.

Chelo at Haj Ali Chelo Kebab, Tabriz

   It is said that it was because of the Persian Qajar King, Naser al-Din
   Shah’s love for the chelo kebab that it became Iran’s national dish.
   For centuries, various types of meats have been marinated and the
   grilled on a skewer and served with rice. Chelo (basmati rice) is how
   most kebabs are served in Iran with 'chelo kebab' being the catch all
   term. Whether its grilled lamb, beef or chicken, when ordering a chelo,
   the meat will come served nestled atop a pile of buttery rice infused
   with saffron and sumac (a red spice) and served with grilled tomatoes.
   The stunning 15th-century covered Tabriz Bazaar is not only home to
   stalls selling all kinds of antiques, spices and carpets but also it is
   home to Haj Ali Chelo Kebab – one of the most historic kebab houses in
   Tabriz. The décor might be basic but it serves arguably the best chelo
   kebabs in the country, thanks to the delicious locally produced butter
   that is melted into the saffron rice.

Kubideh at Shamshiri, Tehran

   Kubideh is the most traditional of Iranian kebabs and is made by
   wrapping (by hand) minced beef or lamb around skewers. The texture has
   to be the right mix of fatty meat for juiciness, spices for flavour,
   and chopped onion for texture to ensure the meat doesn’t dry out or
   slip off the skewer when cooking. Kubideh is usually served with two
   skewers of the wrapped juicy meat so plenty enough to share. One of the
   oldest restaurants in Tehran is Shamshiri (southeast corner of Sabzeh
   Meydan, Panzdah-eh Khordad Street) near the south-east entrance to the
   Grand Bazaar. Expect it to be packed at lunch time with local shop
   owners tucking in alongside ravenous tourists, but if you are lucky
   enough to get a seat you’ll find the best kubideh in town.

Barg at Sharzeh, Shiraz

   Rather than minced meat the barg uses delicious beef sirloin or lamb
   fillets that have been marinating in oil and onions. Unlike the minced
   kubideh the barg doesn’t have juices that dribble down your chin but
   instead the perfectly cooked meat, served on a single skewer, will melt
   in your mouth. Arguably the best kebab restaurant in this ancient city,
   Sharzeh (Vakil Street, Shiraz) is found right by the city’s bustling
   Bazar-e-Vakil (Vakil Bazaar). Persian music wafts through the air,
   mingling with the smells of roasting meats as a raucous crowd of
   traders, shoppers and tourists tuck into kebabs over the two floors.
   This hidden gem serves the best barg of anywhere in Iran – lumps of
   delicious lamb, slowly marinated in lime juice with onions and garlic.

Joojeh at the Shahrzad, Isfahan

   For those looking for something lighter, try the joojeh (grilled
   saffron chicken kebab). Marinated in oil, many locals prefer it to be
   served on the bone, which they think brings out more flavour from the
   chicken. However, many places will have on- or off-the-bone options.

   Try the joojeh at the Shahrzad Restaurant (Abbas Abad Street, Isfahan).
   This popular restaurant with stained-glass windows and impressive
   mirror and tile work, fits right into the Qajar style of architecture
   found throughout the city. This lively, bustling restaurant has a
   fantastic atmosphere and does an exceptionally good joojeh, as well as
   having a good vegetarian selection.

Bakhtiari at the Alborz, Tehran

   The bakhtiari is essentially a mix of the kubideh and the joojeh. One
   chunk of chicken followed by one chunk of minced meat. The melting
   juice of the fatty meat, keep the chicken deliciously moist and is a
   great way to try two different dishes at the same time.

   The Alborz (North Sohrevardi Street, Tehran) is one of Tehran’s most
   exclusive restaurants, serving excellent kebabs of all kinds and the
   bakhtiari is exceptional here. But come here to watch how the capital’s
   glitterati live, eat and socialise. This hot spot is where the city’s
   celebrities will come to enjoy not only the fine kebabs but the wide
   range of deserts, too.

Shishlik at the Shayan, Shandiz

   Famous world over, the shashlik is just delicious chunks of lamb or
   beef on the bone served with rice. The meat may well be beef ribs or
   lamb chops marinated in spices and oil and cooked with the bone to give
   it a deep flavour. The shashlik comes from the town of Shandiz near the
   holy city of Mashhad. For visitors in the area head to Shayan (Shandiz
   Square, Shandiz Town, Mashhad), the original home of the shashlik where
   you can tuck into your meat in the shady garden or eat from the comfort
   of a traditional carpeted bed. There are tables available too if you’re
   feeling less adventurous.

Torsh at the Mahtab Traditional Restaurant, Lahijan

   The kebab torsh, or sour kebab, is luxurious chunks of sirloin beef or
   juicy chicken marinated in a rich sauces made up of garlic, parsley,
   oil, pomegranate paste and walnuts. Its tangy flavour gives the sour
   title but don’t let that put you off. This dish is a speciality of the
   coastal Gilan province, just outside Tehran and Mahtab Traditional
   Restaurant (Golestan Square, Lahijan) does it exceptionally well. Large
   portions all accompanied by bread, baked fresh on the premises. The
   restaurant is also something of a museum to the region’s culture with
   the restaurant built in Gilan style and staff wearing traditional Gilan
   dress serve the local delicacies whilst traditional live music keeps
   guests entertained.

   Torsh Kebabs are a tasty, local treat. Torsh Kebabs are a tasty, local
