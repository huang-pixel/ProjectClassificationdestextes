   Peggy Trowbridge Filippone

   A shish kebab typically consists of meat and vegetables on a skewer and
   is usually grilled. It can contain lamb, beef, fish, or chicken as well
   as vegetables like green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.

   Sometimes shish kebabs feature only meat. A similar meat-only dish
   called chicken satay or sate is found in Thai, Indonesian, Singaporean,
   and Malaysian cuisines.

The Origin of Shish Kebab

   The term shish kebab comes from the Turkish words şiş kebap that mean
   "skewer" and "roast meat," and shish kebab is a signature Turkish meal.
   Kebabs were a natural dietary solution for nomadic tribes in what's now
   Turkey. Unusual meats were marinated not only to tenderize them but
   also to get rid of some of the gamey flavor.

   Today, shish kebabs have expanded into most cultures in some form or
   another:
     * In several Asian countries, there's satay or sate, which is roasted
       skewered meat, usually chicken served with a dipping sauce that's
       often made from peanuts.
     * Japan has yakitori which is grilled skewered fowl.
     * In France, shish kebabs are called brochettes, meaning "skewers."
     * Portuguese espetadas are beef shish kebabs marinated in wine and
       roasted on an open fire. Lahm mishwy is the equivalent of shish
       kebab in Arabic. The meat of choice is usually lamb, and it is
       cooked over a fire on a skewer holder, so the meat never touches
       the grill itself.

Shish Kebab History

   Shish kebabs have a history connected to war. It is said that Turkish
   soldiers used their swords to grill meat in open field fires during
   their invasion of Anatolia. This may not be the first use of cooking
   meat over an open fire, but it's how the name stuck.

   There's historical and artistic evidence that the Greeks of the
   Byzantine era cooked shish kebabs. Homer’s Odyssey mentions them as
   well.

   Meats used in shish kebabs are usually marinated prior to cooking. A
   basic marinade might consist of only olive oil, lemon juice, and
   onions, while a more complex one would include marjoram, crumbled bay
   leaves, cinnamon, allspice, and other spices. The color added by the
   vegetables, such as tomatoes, onion wedges, and green bell peppers,
   that are used to separate the pieces of meat helps make kebabs more
   visually appealing.

Varieties of Shish Kebabs

   There are names for specific shish kebab recipes, including:
     * Orman kebabi: whole roasted lamb
     * Çoban kebabi: a shepherd’s style roast of meat on a stick that is
       driven into the ground before an open-field fire
     * Hacci osman kebabi: a roast on a revolving spit
     * Süt kebabi: meat that's parboiled in milk and then skewered and
       roasted
     * Koyun kebabi: a whole lamb roasted in a covered pit
     * Kabarma kebabi: a grilled fowl split open at the belly, kept whole,
       and flattened with a mallet
     * Kefenli kebabi: roast meat wrapped in a “shroud” of bread

   No matter what kind of kebab you make, cooking your food on a skewer is
   a fun and fast way to put together a tasty meal.
