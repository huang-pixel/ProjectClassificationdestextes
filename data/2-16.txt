Abstract

   Adulteration and incorrect labeling of meat products became a matter of
   great concerns of religious, economical, legal and medical aspects.
   Among meat products, kebab is considered one of the most favorable in
   Iraq, which makes it prone to adulteration. This study was carried out
   to evaluate the quality of kebab by detecting the origin of animal
   species meat in it; using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) based Polymerase
   Chain Reaction (PCR) under laboratory conditions. For this purpose
   kebab was prepared as per the standardized processing schedule using
   pure mutton and beef meat in ratio 80:20 and chicken meat in five
   ratios ;70:20:10, 65:20:15, 60:20:20,55:20:25 and 50:20:30,
   respectively. DNA was extracted successfully from pure species meat and
   from all mixed kebab above, then PCR was carried out using
   species-specific primers, to amplify mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b)
   gene. The results revealed specific amplified fragments with 133, 300
   and 585 bp for pure chicken, beef and sheep, respectively, and in the
   mixed grilled samples, the detection limit of chicken was 10%,
   indicating that the cooking (grinding) and addition of non-meat
   ingredients showed no effect on the detection of meat species. The
   results of this study proved mtDNA-PCR to be effective and reliable for
   detecting the origin of animal species meat . This method of detection
   could be applied in quality control laboratories for detect
   adulteration in different kinds of traditional grilled kebab in Iraqi
   restaurants.
