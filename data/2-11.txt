Abstract

   Background: Epidemiologic studies indicated that dietary pattern plays
   a determinant role in cancer incidence. They also indicated that 1/3 of
   cancers are associated to foods. Diet contains different carcinogenic
   agents: naturally occurring chemicals, synthetic components and
   compounds produced during cooking such as kebab. This traditional food
   is one of the most popular foods in the Middle East, particularly in
   Iran. Red meat, especially lamb or veal, is the most common meat used
   in preparation of kebab. Since kebab is considered as a food containing
   carcinogenic compounds, so the purpose of this study was to assess the
   consumption pattern of kebab in a sample of Iranian adults and its
   relationship with demographic characteristics.

   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between
   March and April 2015 on 705 Iranian adults who were living in
   Kermanshah province in the west of Iran. Subjects were selected
   randomly from different districts of Kermanshah. Data were collected
   through a questionnaire survey which had been designed by academic
   members of Department of Nutrition at Kermanshah University of Medical
   Sciences. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. The
   results were expressed as mean ± SD. Student’s t-test, ANOVA and
   chi-square tests were performed to compare the study groups. The
   normality of data was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All
   results were analyzed using a significance level of P <0.05.

   Results: The results indicated that nearly 60% of subjects have a high
   tendency to consume kebab. The average of kebab consumption among the
   participants in this study was 4 times per month. Nearly, 85% of study
   participants tended to consume kebab with a large amount of salt. The
   chi-square test determined the significant difference between education
   and tendency to consume kebab; individuals with higher level of
   education had more tendency to consume kebab than those having lower
   level of education (p=0.021). In this study, 93.9% of participants used
   charcoal, a cooking fuel, to prepare kebab.

   Conclusion: The results of this study point out that the study
   participants, regardless of socio-economic status, consume high amounts
   of kebab, and thus this unhealthy eating habit will increase the risk
   of carcinogenesis. Therefore, the immediate attention of Public Health
   Officials is required.
   Key Words: Kebab, Dietary pattern, Cancer

Introduction

   Cancer is one of the major public health problems in Iran. According to
   the latest statistical and epidemiological studies in Iran, after
   cardiovascular disease and unintentional injuries, cancer is the third
   leading cause of death. Over 30000 people die of the disease annually,
   and it is estimated that more than 70,000 new cases of cancer deaths
   will occur each year in the country. Cancer incidence rate in Iran is
   135 in 100000 per year. The increase in life expectancy and the aging
   of population will sharply rise the incidence of cancer in the next
   decade^1

   Many epidemiologic studies, both in human and in animal models, have
   suggested that dietary pattern plays an important role in cancer
   incidence. Epidemiologic studies indicated that 1/3 of cancers are
   associated to foods^2.

   Cancer is a common expression which describes a condition in which
   cells divide without control and these abnormal cells can spread to
   different parts of the body by blood or lymphatic system. Cancer is
   best-known cause of deaths worldwide, with nearly 14 million new cases
   and 1.8 million deaths in the year^3^, ^4.

   Diet contains different carcinogenic agents: naturally occurring
   chemicals, synthetic components and compounds produced during cooking.
   In the last decades, researchers have focused a lot of attention on
   toxic agents which are produce during cooking process^5. Method of
   cooking is a considerable source of toxicants that may have adverse
   health effects^6. Type of dietary pattern, frequency of consumption and
   the kind of cooking method are most important determinants which
   appoint the level of risk of exposure to these agents. Investigators
   have shown that barbecued and charcoal grilled foods have high
   concentration of toxicants mostly because of fat and protein contents
   of the mentioned foods^5. Grilled foods are becoming more and more
   popular (usually due to being palatable and ease of cooking) both at
   home and in restaurants, so as mentioned above, especial attention must
   be given to foods which are produced by these methods because they have
   more carcinogenic compounds in comparison with the other methods^7^,^8.

   Regarding the fuel type, it should be noted that several heating
   sources are used for cooking worldwide, including wood or charcoal,
   coal, kerosene, gas, electrical energy, etc.^6. Cooking of foods,
   especially kebab, by charcoal can be dangerous due to the formation of
   carcinogens^7.

   Human beings eat foods (a combination of different nutrients), and
   these nutrients definitely have synergetic effects on health
   parameters. Dietary pattern is a more extended expression which
   includes all different types of foods and nutrients, the way of their
   consumption, etc., and it is also a more powerful predictor of
   individual health and disease related to foods^9^,^10.

   Kebab is one of the most popular foods in the Middle East, particularly
   in Iran. Red meat, especially lamb or veal, is the most common meat
   used in preparation of kebab. In Iran, there are about seven types of
   kebab, including Kubide, Juje, Bakhtiari, Soltani, Dande, Fish and
   Barg. They are different in preparation methods, additives and may be
   in the kind of meat consumed (red meat, fish, fowl, etc). Kebab may be
   served with rice (chelow kebab) or special kinds of breads such as
   Sangak or Lavash. Kermanshah is a province located in the west of Iran,
   and it seems likely that people living there are interest in the
   consumption of meat, especially red meat, in the form of kebab as
   described previously. To date, no study has conducted to assess this
   dietary pattern in Iran, especially in this province, and it is a
   unique presentation in this field. Since kebab is considered as a food
   containing carcinogenic compounds, so the purpose of this study was to
   assess the consumption pattern of kebab in a sample of Iranian adults
   and its relationship with demographic characteristics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2015
   on 705 Iranian adults who were living in Kermanshah, a province in west
   of Iran. Subjects were selected randomly from different districts of
   Kermanshah. The data were collected using a questionnaire which had
   been designed by academic members of Department of Nutrition at
   Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences. Since kebab is among the
   most popular Iranian foods and has a particular recipe, so there is not
   any international or standard questionnaire to measure the pattern of
   this food consumption. In this study, researchers prepared a
   questionnaire in which common patterns and pathophysiologic mechanisms
   of this pattern were considered. Validity and reliability of
   questionnaire were confirmed under supervision of several local
   nutritionists who were familiar with the dietary pattern of people in
   Kermanshah. We also conducted a pilot study to address potential
   problems of questionnaire (results of the pilot study have not been
   mentioned). This questionnaire had two components: the first part was
   about demographic characteristics of subjects and the second one
   consisted of questions about the pattern of kebab consumption. The
   questionnaire contained 21 questions, 9 of which were about demographic
   characteristics (age, job, level of education, address, etc.), and the
   rest was about kebab consumption patterns (frequency of intake,
   interest in the use of kebab, types of kebab, methods of cooking, place
   of consumption, amount of salt intake, etc.) . In the questionnaire, we
   asked participants “How much are you willing to eat kebab?”. To answer
   to the question, four options were considered: low, medium, high and
   very high. We also asked participants two questions regarding their
   desire to consume salt with kebab. If the answer was positive, then
   they were asked about the amount of intake salt (low, medium, high or
   very high). Study participants, in terms of levels of education, were
   categorized as follows: illiterate, elementary, cycle, diploma,
   bachelor or above. In terms of jobs, they were classified to the
   unemployed, free and governmental. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
   as weight (in kg) divided by height (in m^2). Data collection was
   conducted in the way of face to face interview by three trained
   dietitians. For statistical analysis, we assessed normal distribution
   of data by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data analysis was performed
   using SPSS Version 20. The results were expressed as mean ± SD.
   Student’s t-test, ANOVA and chi-square tests were performed to compare
   the study groups. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

   This study included 705 participants (51.3% were male and 48.7% were
   female) with a mean age of 35 ± 10 years. In the present study, there
   was no significant difference between the mean age of men and women
   (Characteristics of subjects are shown in Table 1).

   The rate of tendency to consume kebab

   The average of kebab consumption among the participants in this study
   was 4 times per a month, and this average in men was significantly more
   than in women (4.2±2.7 vs 3.8±2.6; p<0.03). Mean of BMI was more in men
   who had more tendency to consume kebab than those who had low tendency
   (25.3±3.7 vs 24.5±2.9; p<0.01).The relationship between age of subjects
   and their desire to consume kebab was not significant, but there was a
   statistically significant difference between gender of subjects and
   their desire to consume kebab (p<0.02). Men were more likely than women
   to consume kebab. More than 85% of participants in this study were
   interested in eating kebab with salt. We also found out a significant
   relationship between level of education and the tendency to consume
   kebab; participants with high level of education had more tendency to
   consume kebab than those having low level of education (p=0.02). The
   results obtained regarding the consumption of salt with kebab were
   different; the consumption of salt was higher among participants with
   low level of education in comparison to their more educated
   counterparts (p<0.033). Among the different kinds of kebabs, 39% and
   37.4% of participants tended to consume chicken and kubideh kebab,
   respectively. Kubideh, as described previously, is a fatty meat mixed
   with onion and specific spices. These ingredients are mixed together,
   and then pressed around a skewer.

   In this study, 93.9% of people used charcoal as a cooking fuel to
   prepare kebab. The results showed that 64.4% of subjects preferred to
   prepare and consume kebab at home. One of the questions asked from the
   participants was “what would be the food of your choice in the offered
   menu when you go to the restaurant for a meal?” and more than 60%
   selected kebab, 37.7% kubideh kebab with rice and 25.9% Jujeh kebab. In
   order to make Jujeh kebab, the chicken has to be marinated in onion,
   lemon juice, saffron , and salt before it goes to the grill. It is
   sometimes served with grilled tomato and pepper.

Discussion

   65.5% of main causes of death from non-communicable diseases are
   because of chronic disease such as diabetes, cancer, etc. Dietary
   pattern should receive more attention for being one of the most
   important risk factors for the above-mentioned diseases ^11.

   People living all over the world and also in different latitudes a
   country based on weather status, available food resources, various
   kinds of ethnic groups, etc. follow different dietary patterns, and
   this different dietary pattern have different effects on diseases. In
   Iran, kebab is served in all restaurants across the country.

   Some types of carcinogenic compounds, including heterocyclic amines
   (HA[s]) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH[s]) are produced
   during such cooking methods which occur at high temperature (barbecue,
   grilling)^12. Professor Sugimura discovered these compounds about 30
   years ago^13. To date, about 100 kinds of PAH[s] have been recognized,
   and some of them are confirmed to be carcinogenic. As mentioned above,
   these compounds are produced during pyrolysis process of components
   like fats and direct heat. So cooking method and fat content of meats
   are two major determinants in a carcinogenic food ^14.

   HA[s] are categorized into two main groups: ‘‘thermic HA[s]’’ and
   “pyrolytic HA[s]’’. Thermic HA[s] are formed complex pathway named
   Maillard reaction at temperatures between 150 and 250 degree Celsius
   (°C) and pyrolytic HA[s] are produced at temperatures above
   250(°C)^5^,^15. It has been demonstrated that smoke of barbecued foods
   can be harmful because inhalation and also dermal contact to PAH[s] can
   expose human to these compounds^7.

   Different cultures have different dietary patterns and cooking methods,
   so due to these differences, individuals may be exposed to different
   types of pathogenic compounds, including carcinogenic compounds5. For
   instance, reducing heating time can reduce Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) content
   of foods^14. Studies also demonstrated that cooked meats which contain
   high levels of heterocyclic amines can lead to an increased risk of
   colorectal^16, pancreas ^17^-^18 and prostate^19^-^20 cancers. One
   study has shown that eating each 10 grams of well-down red meat is
   correlated with increasing risk of colorectal adenoma by 29% ^13. In
   another study in Argentina, consumption of all kinds of grilled meats
   had a significant positive relationship with colorectal cancer ^21.

   According to the results of this study, more than half of those
   surveyed had a high tendency to consume kebab and remarkable percentage
   of whom were using charcoal as a cooking fuel to prepare barbecue. The
   noteworthy point is that the tendency and kebab consumption patterns
   were irrelevant to most of socio-economic factors (gender, Job…). In
   this study, individuals with high level of education were more likely
   to use barbecue than those who had low level of education and they
   followed an unhealthy pattern (Use larger amount of salt, etc) to
   consume kebab. This consumption pattern can be related to being
   pleasant and dainty of barbecue, easy access and ease of cooking. As
   noted above, most of the participants preferred to consume kebab at
   home and, in restaurants, they preferred to order kebab .

CONCLUSION

   Based on the findings of this study, it can be said that cooking
   barbecue in Kermanshah doesn’t follow the healthy pattern, and
   according to the mentioned mechanisms it can be considered as a
   powerful risk factor in development of cancer that needs to be
   modified.

   However, to derive an absolute conclusion about the association between
   cancer and the use of barbecues such as kebab we need to do more
   researches. Most scientists and nutritionists in industrialized
   countries have recommended decreasing consumption of barbecue^14.

   To minimize these compounds in diet, it is recommended to avoid direct
   exposure of meat to cooking surface (exactly similar to what happens in
   kebab preparation), and reduce cooking times to decrease HA[s] and
   PAH[s] contents. Cooking meat, especially by using a microwave, can
   reduce carcinogenic compounds. Moving and turning meat during cooking
   process can reduce the formation of PAH[s] compared with methods in
   which meat is not stirred during cooking. When making barbecue, it
   should be noted that high temperatures will lead to the formation of
   carcinogenic compounds in barbecue^22. We also recommend using large
   amounts of fruits and vegetables because they are rich in fiber,
   vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and photochemical, which help to
   protect the body against carcinogenic compounds.
