Know Your Döner Kebap — History Overview and Selected Dishes

   Döner kebap, or in short döner, is known almost all around the world.
   Sure, ingredients and sauces vary, and often it even comes under a
   different name. Shawarma, gyros, tacos al pastor, sufllaqe or kabab
   Torki are some of the derivations of it. But the döner basics remain
   the same: beaten pieces of meat are seasoned with suet, local herbs and
   spices, skewered on a spit and grilled vertically. Originally the meat
   used for döner kebap was lamb. Today, in Istanbul, it is made of a lamb
   and beef mixture, or even only beef.

The Origin of Döner Kebap

   Most anthropologists claim that cooking fires started about 250.000
   years ago, yet there isn’t any clear proof about the beginning of
   cooking in the history of mankind. Probably some kind of kebab has been
   consumed since the day mankind started using fire for cooking. In
   Sumerian, kabuba means to cook on ember and in Arabic it means to fry
   meat. In the Turkish period it gained today’s meaning: grilled or
   broiled meat on a (vertical) skewer or stick.

   It is considered that kebabs come from an earlier time when Nomadic
   tribesmen grilled meat on their swords. In his 18th century travel
   books, Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi mentions kebab as a horizontal
   stack of meat. In the 1860s Iskender Efendi from Bursa contributes to
   the kebab with a new angle – vertical grilling and serving it in thin
   slices. The döner kebap, which simply means rotating kebab, stands out
   as an innovation in the history of Turkish cuisine.

Famous Döner Kebap Dishes

   The overview below is by no means a complete list of all döner dishes
   available. It’s just a sample of some you may want to try out during
   your stay. You can find these dishes all around the city, whether in a
   chic or a modest small restaurant.
     * Döner Kebap is served in various ways. The meat used can be lamb,
       lamb and beef or chicken. In restaurants it mostly comes on a plate
       with rice or fried potatoes, and salad on the side. Since it has
       recently become a fast-food dish too, you can also get it as a
       sandwich in between pide – pita like traditional thick bread.
     * Döner Dürüm is another very delicious serving style of döner meat
       which is wrapped Picture of a plate of Bursa İskender Kebap in

       in lavaş – tortilla like thin leaves of bread. The accompanying
       ingredients like green salad, fried potatoes, pickles or hot tomato
       sauce are optional. So ask what you can have in the wrap and add or
       omit according to your taste. Sometimes dürüm is made by using
       grilled minced meat brochettes mounted on a wide skewer, again
       wrapped in lavaş. There is no better or worse, it is all about
       preference.
     * İskender Kebap is the döner meat served on pieces of pide dressed
       with butter and yogurt on a side of the plate. If preferred, tomato
       sauce and extra butter can be used for dressing. It is also known
       as Bursa Kebabı. It’s one of my personal favorites.
