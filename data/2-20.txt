While you may be familiar with döner kebab, there is actually a vast variety
of intricate and delectable kebab meat dishes to sink your teeth into in
Turkey

   Kebab is the widely referred to name for a variety of meat dishes
   derived from the Middle East that are either cooked on a skewer over a
   grill or in a vessel. The word kebab is said to be derived from the
   Sumerian term “kabuba,” which means to char and is used in Arabic and
   Turkish to denote meat dishes. Throughout history, the people of
   Anatolia and neighboring regions have discovered, developed and
   perfected a number of delicious kebab dishes that go way beyond the
   döner kebab or gyros that are more popularly known.

   The ingredients in kebabs can vary between lamb, mutton and beef. Some
   are skewered, and some are stewed. Most kebabs are served with yogurt
   and tomato sauce and either rice, wraps or pide, while some are even
   prepared with fruits and nuts. The following is a list of the most
   legendary kebabs to try in Turkey:

   Döner kebab gets around

   Referred to as both “döner” and “gyros,” the döner kebab along with
   shish kebab are the most familiar forms of kebab known worldwide, and
   both are delicious specialties in their own right. Döner is named after
   the rotating spit used to cook upright stacked meat, which is then cut
   into very thin slices. This fast-food variety is then encased by bread
   or a lavash wrap and filled with thinly sliced onions, parsley,
   tomatoes and papers to easily be eaten on the go.

   A family legacy: Iskender kebab

   One of the most famous and beloved forms of döner kebab is iskender
   kebab with thin slices of döner served over cubes of freshly baked pide
   bread, topped with tomato sauce and accompanied by yogurt, which is
   then doused in sizzling butter at the table. Named after its inventor
   Iskender Efendi, who not only developed this signature dish but at the
   age of 12 invented the entire rotating spit concept for cooking layered
   meat vertically, iskender kebab has been trademarked by and synonymous
   with Bursa’s Iskenderoğlu family since the late 19th century. The
   signature shop is in Bursa, and the family has since branched out to
   operate nearly a dozen restaurants nationwide. However, the dish is so
   beloved by the Turks, you can still find it served up occasionally
   under its well-known name iskender or other creative variations.

   Lost in translation: Çöp şiş

   With an unfortunate name that has countless times been translated as
   “rubbage sticks” due to the most familiar meaning of the word "çöp"
   just happening to translate from Turkish into trash, çöp şiş is one of
   the most widespread kebabs that is best referred to in English as the
   classic shish kebab, albeit a skinnier variety. Consisting of scraps of
   meat (which may be the reason behind the name) that are marinated in
   garlic, tomatoes and thyme before being shaped onto wooden skewers and
   cooked over a grill, this dish is generally served with grilled peppers
   and onions and rice or can be wrapped in lavash bread and is one of the
   rare kebabs to have a widespread chicken variation.

   Don’t be puzzled: Şaşlık is shish kebab

   Şaşlık kebab is actually synonymous with shish kebab and consists of
   significant chunks of lamb that are marinated in vinegar and layered on
   a wooden skewer with onions and other vegetables.

   Tale of two cities: Adana and Urfa

   Adana and Urfa are the names of two types of kebabs that are both
   prepared using minced meat, which is molded into patties on flat iron
   skewers and grilled over a burning flame. Named after the two cities in
   Turkey most famed for their kebabs, the only difference between the two
   is the level of spiciness with Adana kebab bringing on the heat and
   Urfa kebab being more subtle.

   Legendary beyti kebab

   Named after the owner of Beyti, the most famous meat restaurant in
   Istanbul, beyti kebab is a visual delight as patties made from ground
   beef or lamb that are shaped and grilled on skewers are then wrapped in
   a lavash and cut into bite-sized slices, which are traditionally spread
   out into a spiral on the plate and then doused with tomato sauce and
   yogurt.

   You say Çökertme, I say Bodrum

   Referred to as both Çökertme and Bodrum kebab, this particular
   variation is made from marinated strips of veal served over shoestring
   potatoes, which is slathered in tomato sauce followed by garlic yogurt
   and served accompanied by fried tomatoes and green peppers. Popular in
   all of Muğla province, Çökertme is the name of a village in Milas where
   it is believed this dish was discovered.

   Break bread for Tirit kebab

   Tirit kebab is a popular hailing from the Central Anatolian region of
   Konya in Turkey. The delicacy is generally prepared with lamb but can
   include a number of variations in meats. The most standout feature of
   this dish is that it uses leftover bread that is reheated and used as a
   bed for the stewed meat which is then covered in yogurt.

   Divine smoked eggplant: Alinazik

   With a history hailing back to the Ottoman era and the time of Sultan
   Selim I, or Selim the Grim, Alinazik kebab is a beloved combination of
   cubed lamb laid over a bed of smoked and spiced eggplant. The name is
   said to have been a derivation of a combination of the Arabic word
   “Ala” to mean beautiful and “nazik,” which means food. However, legend
   has it that when the sultan was first served this dish, he asked whose
   “kind hands,” which is the translation from Turkish, were responsible
   for creating the dish. Nonetheless, the puffy pillow base of pureed
   smoked eggplant mixed with garlic and yogurt serves as the ultimate
   accompaniment to savory stewed lamb. (Here's the recipe.)

   Breaking pots for testi kebab

   Hailing from the touristic Cappadocia region of Turkey, testi kebab is
   an extravagant lamb or beef and vegetable stew that is cooked in a clay
   pot, which is then cracked open at the table to serve.

   Ain’t it a peach: Şeftali kebab

   A signature dish from Cyprus, despite the name being şeftali kebab,
   which translates from Turkish into peach kebab, there is actually no
   fruit used in this kebab, which is a type of crepinette. In other
   words, a skinless sausage stuffed with caul fat or stomach membrane and
   grilled on a skewer. Meanwhile, the name is a misnomer as this kebab is
   said to have actually been named after Chef Ali who originally prepared
   it.

   Brave new world: Yenidünya kebab

   Yeni Dünya has two meanings in Turkish, one being “new world” and the
   other being “loquat.” Hailing from the nation’s culinary capital
   Gaziantep, the yenidünya kebab is thus a kebab made from the
   picturesque layering of loquats and köfte meatballs to either be
   grilled on a skewer or baked in an oven.

   Going nuts: Antepfıstıklı kebab

   The most famous kebab to come from Gaziantep, however, has to be
   antepfıstıklı kebab, which is made with pistachios, a nut the region is
   famed for. In this kebab, minced meat is mixed with pistachios, onions
   and garlic and then shaped onto a flat skewer and grilled.
