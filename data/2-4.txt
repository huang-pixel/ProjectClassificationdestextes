Turkish Kebab Culture

   April 6, 2021 • 0 Comment

   If we talk about Turkish Kebab, it is necessary to start from the word
   “kebab” first. The roots, the meaning, and definitions of “kebab” word
   will guide us on the rest of our blog.

   Based on the word “kebab” and looking at the definitions and the
   meaning it takes in historical periods, it can be said that kebab has
   existed since the fire has been discovered.

   According to the official dictionary of the Turkish Language
   Association, kebab means meat cooked directly on the fire or in a
   container without water, yet, tomatoes and peppers are also included in
   the definition of kebab for today’s Turkish food culture understanding.
   Many experts commented that waiting around the fire for the meat to be
   cooked was the basis for the establishment of the dining-table culture
   during the periods when the fire was discovered and the meat was used
   for cooking, that is, when the kebab was cooked for the first time.

   The word kebab comes from the word “kabuba”, which means to grill in
   the Sumerian language. According to some sources, kebab is a general
   definition given to meat dishes of Arabic origin. From these
   explanations, it is stated that the arrival of kebab in Anatolia was
   made by “fellahs” who migrated to Adana (Cilicia of ancient times) from
   Arab countries for cultivation purposes.

   In addition to all this, in some history books that Persian ruler
   Darius has depicted when he is giving fried meat pieces to his soldiers
   with a thick skewer before going to war. At that time, kebab, in other
   words fried meat, means an indicator of strength and wealth. In the
   history of humankind, eating and drinking culture has been formed by
   multi-stage transitions and kebab has developed in parallel with this.

   In the first nomadic societies, people are seen to be gatherers.
   Especially women tried to live with the gathering until they learned
   how to hunt. When the physical strength of the men increased, they
   started hunting, first ate the meat they hunted raw, and then, after
   the fire was found, they started to cook the meat by trial and error.
   Accordingly, it can be said that the use of spices started before kebab
   to protect the meat from decaying.

   Cooking techniques started to increase when human societies began to
   sacrifice to their gods for their beliefs. The technique of beating
   meat and cutting it into small pieces, which we call minced meat today,
   also developed in this period.

Turkish Kebab Culture

   Although kebab has an important place in Turkish cuisine, it has gained
   its deserved place maybe only in recent years. In recent years, the
   development of kebab restaurants and their transformation into elegant
   restaurants, the changes in the presentation of kebabs helped Turkish
   cuisine gain its worldwide reputation. In addition to its history and
   taste, kebab attracts the attention of the leading chefs of world
   cuisines with its presentation. Therefore, the known name of the kebab
   is now Turkish Kebab worldwide.

   Considering its presentation, the kebab becomes healthier with the
   accompanying vegetables and greens. Especially onion and garlic
   accompanying kebabs are used as natural antibiotics for four seasons.
   When the pomegranate syrup, fruits and vegetables used in other kebab
   varieties are examined one by one, it is seen that kebab consumption is
   quite healthy.

   In Anatolia where covered by Turkey, kebab is seasoned with herbs. So
   much so that when the Southeastern Anatolia region is considered, even
   in physically close cities, kebab has been flavored with different
   spices and called with different names. For example, kebab names are
   called Adana Kebab, Urfa Kebab, Antep Kebab, although the cities are
   next to each other. The hot spice used has also become decisive for
   kebab names over time.

   When it comes to Ottoman Cuisine, one of the biggest discussions is
   whether there was kebab in the palace cuisine. While “kebab”, which is
   in our minds today, is served with meat and tomatoes, peppers, onions,
   parsley and sometimes radish, the definition of kebab in “Palace
   Cuisine” is much different. Looking at the sources, it is seen that he
   was in the kitchen after the Mehmed the Conqueror period which is
   around mid-15^th century.

   In addition, one of the most interesting points about kebab in the
   sources belonging to the Ottoman Palace Cuisine is that sometimes the
   meat is cooked on the stem of the eggplant instead of the skewer.
   Another example of this is the cooking of kebab by sticking pieces of
   meat on the stem of a bay leaf.

   When kebab is examined based on regions and cities, it is understood
   that the form of kebab made from the materials used contains the local
   culture. While the use of fruit in kebab types is very common in Syria
   and especially in Aleppo cuisine, we see that the use of fruit in
   kebabs is very rare in other culinary cultures of Anatolia except
   Gaziantep cuisine. It can be said that some similarities between
   Gaziantep and Aleppo cuisine are due to the geographical proximity.
   While it is noteworthy that spices are determinant in Adana and Urfa
   cuisine, kebab is distinguished from others with its meat selection in
   some regions.

How to Cook Turkish Kebab

   It is very important to choose the right meat according to the type of
   meat used in the kebab, its being rested, the way it was prepared and
   the type of the kebab.

   The meat and fat ratio should be adjusted according to the type of
   kebabs with minced meat.

   Cubed kebab dries up if kept waiting after sticking the skewer. The
   meats should be soaked with the water to be taken by hand.

   If the kebab does not dry, it makes it delicious.

   For seasoning in kebabs, ground red pepper should be added instead of
   chili peppers.

   There are many ways of seasoning the kebabs with the ingredients are
   olive oil, milk, yogurt, onion, garlic, mixed spices and even vinegar.

   If the cubed meat to be used in kebab is thought to be hard, it should
   be marinated with yogurt overnight. The next day, the desired seasoning
   is made and the kebab is cooked.

   When the kebab is to be made, if the meat is in the refrigerator, it is
   removed beforehand and kept at room temperature.

   The type of coal used should be long-lasting and the heat of the fire
   should be adjusted.

   Cubed-cut liver, chicken and minced meat kebabs should be cooked over
   the same fire.

   Onion, garlic and eggplant kebabs, on the other hand, should be cooked
   over a stronger fire.

   Kebab shouldn’t be cooked at low oven temperature. Because the meat
   requires strong heat, it dries before cooking otherwise.

   Before putting the meat to the oven, warm water should be sprinkled on
   the meat surface according to the type of kebab. It should be sprinkled
   more especially on onion and garlic kebabs.
